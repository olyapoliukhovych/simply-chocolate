# Simply Chocolate

A sleek, responsive landing page for a premium chocolate brand. This project focuses on high-quality visuals, smooth transitions, and a clean user journey from product discovery to customer reviews.

## ✨ What's inside?

I built this project to practice creating a cohesive brand experience. Here’s what it covers:
* **The Goods:** Sections for Benefits, Ingredients, and our Product lineup.
* **Storytelling:** A "How It's Made" section to give users a peek behind the scenes.
* **Social Proof:** A dedicated Reviews section and a "Top Sellers" showcase.
* **Modern UI:** Clean layouts that let the photography do the talking.

## 🛠 My Process

* **Mobile-First:** I started with the phone view to make sure those product images look great on small screens.
* **Accessibility:** Prioritized inclusivity by adhering to WCAG best practices, ensuring screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.
* **Performance:** Optimized those "delicious" images so the page loads faster.
